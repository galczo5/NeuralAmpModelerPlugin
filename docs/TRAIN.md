## How to use (Google Colab)

If you don't have a good computer for training ML models, you use Google Colab to train
in the cloud using the pre-made notebooks under `bin\train`.

For the very easiest experience, open
[`easy_colab.ipynb` on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler/blob/b1aa204/bin/train/easy_colab.ipynb)
and follow the steps!

For a little more visibility under the hood, you can use [colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler/blob/main/bin/train/colab.ipynb) instead.

**Pros:**

- No local installation required!
- Decent GPUs are available if you don't have one on your computer.

**Cons:**

- Uploading your data can take a long time.
- The session will time out after a few hours (for free accounts), so extended
  training runs aren't really feasible. Also, there's a usage limit so you can't hang
  out all day. I've tried to set you up with a good model that should train reasonably
  quickly!
